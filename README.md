# Human Resource Email Support System
Human Resource Email Support is my Internship Project at GECO Philippine Incorporation. This project intended to help HR to send multiple files in multiple and single email. Also it uses CRUD functionality to add, update, edit and delete data. 
It has features to archive all data and view history of the email status either send or fail.

# Getting Started 
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


## Development
Before running a PHP script, you must know where to write it. 
In the XAMPP directory, there exists a folder called “htdocs”. This is where all the programs for the web pages will be stored.
Now, to run a PHP script:

1. Go to “C:\xampp\htdocs” and inside it, create a folder. Let’s call it “demo”. It’s considered good practice to create a new folder for every project you work on.
2. Inside the demo folder, create a new text file and name it “index.php” and write the following script.
3. Now, to see the script output, open the XAMPP control panel and start Apache to host the local webserver, where our script will be running.
4. Now navigate to your browser and type in “localhost/demo/” in the address bar to view the output.
